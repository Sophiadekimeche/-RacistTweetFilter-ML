# -RacistTweetFilter-ML

## Description

This project aims to detect and filter out racist tweets using a machine learning model. The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. Users can enter a tweet, and the app will predict whether the tweet is racist or not.

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application file.
- `prediction_page.py`: Secondary script containing prediction logic.
- `model.pkl`: Saved machine learning model.
- `vectorizer.pkl`: Saved TF-IDF vectorizer.
- `tweeter and X LOGO.jpg`: Image file used in the app.
- `racism graphs comparison canada and rest of the world.pdf`: PDF file used in the app.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the app.
